// There are two examples of suppressing CheckStyle
// warnings in this class. If you create new classes
// that mirror data in MongoDB and that will be managed
// by MongoJack, then you'll probably need to suppress
// the same warnings in your classes as well so that
// CheckStyle doesn't shout at you and cause the build
// to fail.

// Normally you'd want all fields to be private, but
// we need the fields in this class to be public since
// they will be written to by Mongo via the MongoJack
// library. We need to suppress the Visibility Modifier
// (https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_design.html#VisibilityModifier)
// check in CheckStyle so that we don't get a failed
// build when Gradle runs CheckStyle.

  // By default Java field names shouldn't start with underscores.
  // Here, though, we *have* to use the name `_id` to match the
  // name of the field as used by MongoDB.

  // Having some kind of `toString()` allows us to print `Todo`s,
  // which can be useful/necessary in error handling. This only
  // returns the body, but it could be extended to return more or
  // all of the fields combined into a single string.
  //
  // The other option would be to return `_id`, but that can be
  // `null` if we're trying to add a new `Todo` to the database
  // that doesn't yet have an `_id`, so returning `name` seemed
  // the better bet.
